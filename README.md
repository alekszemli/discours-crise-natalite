## 📖 Abstract
Drawing on concepts of **demographic anxiety** (É. Krause) and **moral panic** (S. Cohen), the study compares 104 French and 302 Russian newspaper articles across different political orientations.  

The analysis combines:
- **Quantitative textometric methods** (word frequencies, co-occurrences, lexical portraits via *R.temis* in RStudio)  
- **Qualitative discourse analysis** (tone of titles, emotional vocabulary, expert citations, argumentative framing)

## 🗂 Corpus
- **France (104 articles)**: *Le Figaro, Les Échos, Le Monde, Libération, La Croix*  
- **Russia (302 articles)**: *Nezavisimaïa Gazeta, Kommersant, Novaïa Gazeta, Meduza*  
- **Keywords searched**: *“natalité”*, *“crise de natalité”*, *“hiver démographique”*  
- **Period covered**: 2020–2025

## 🔍 Main Findings
- Both French and Russian media construct an **alarmist vision** of demographic decline.  
- Elements of **demographic anxiety** appear in all newspapers.  
- Traits of **moral panic** emerge selectively, depending on political alignment and proximity to the state.  
- Common rhetorical strategies include:
  - Presenting fertility decline as unprecedented  
  - Depersonalizing natality (detached from individual lives, especially women’s)  
  - Linking demographic concerns to family norms, immigration, and national identity

## 🎯 Contribution
This thesis contributes to the sociology of population policies and media studies by showing how demographic discourse functions as a **political, emotional, and gendered construction** in both contexts.
